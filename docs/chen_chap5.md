# Chapter 5: Carbon Reward Policy - Technical Summary

## 5.1 Policy Type

**Classification:** Mitigate-and-trade policy (Class 4 in the policy matrix)

**Core Framework:**
- **NO STICKS approach** - No direct costs imposed on market actors or governments
- Establishes minimum price for carbon dioxide removal (CDR)
- Establishes adaptive prices for conventional mitigation
- Targets non-binding mitigation roadmap through voluntary participation
- Countries support policy collaboratively rather than through binding emissions limits

**Key Features (from Definition Box 6):**
- **Systemic Externality Addressed:** Unpriced systemic risk to the carbon cycle
- **Policy Objective:** Achieve systemic safety by remaining within a relatively 'safe' GHG emissions budget
- **Asset Supply:** Carbon-linked financial asset (XCR) issued for:
  - Carbon dioxide removal (CDR)
  - Cost-effective conventional mitigation aligned with declared mitigation roadmap
  - Supplied under long-term contracts that roll forward in time
- **Asset Demand:** Central banks act as 'market makers' guaranteeing XCR price floor; purchase XCR when spot price threatens to fall below floor
- **Price Discovery:** Voluntary XCR trading in FX markets via Coasean bargaining to distribute mitigation costs across financial markets for Pareto optimal outcomes

## 5.2 Naming the Market Instrument

**Historical Evolution:**
- Originally: '4C' (complementary currency for climate change) - Chen et al. 2017
- Then: CBDC (central bank digital currency) - Chen 2018
- 2021-2025: 'XCC' (carbon currency)
- **Current (2025):** 'XCR' (carbon reward)

**Technical Classification:**
- **NOT a currency** - not a medium of exchange
- **NOT a carbon credit** - doesn't transfer ownership of mitigated carbon
- **IS:** Carbon-linked sovereign-backed asset

**ISO 4217 Registration:**
- Proposed code: **XCR**
- Aligns with 'X series' (precious metals, supranational units, specialized monetary operations)
- Examples: XAU (gold), XAG (silver), XDR (IMF Special Drawing Rights), XCD (East Caribbean Dollar)

## 5.3 Mitigation Roadmap & Reward Channels

### Declared Mitigation Roadmap (Figure 9)
Non-binding landscape comprising:
1. **Maximum feasible rate** of conventional GHG mitigation
2. **Minimum feasible rate** of residual GHG emissions
3. **Minimum required rate** of CDR

**Target:** Align with Paris Agreement (well below +2°C, ideally +1.5°C)

**Participation Requirements:**
- Countries agree in principle to roadmap (non-binding)
- Market actors declare portfolio of mitigation projects covering entire operations
- Individual projects assessed through Reward Channels 1 or 2

### Reward Channel 1: CDR Projects
- **Scope:** Engineered, natural, and hybrid CDR methods meeting governance criteria
- **Pricing:** Global reward price (level playing field)
- **Scale:** Within IPCC estimate of 100-1,000 GtCO₂e for 2020-2100 to remain within +1.5°C limit
- **Function:** Neutralize residual emissions and address historical emissions

### Reward Channel 2: Conventional Mitigation Projects
- **Scope:** All sectors reducing/avoiding CO₂e emissions
  - Fossil fuel extraction and consumption reduction
  - Electricity generation
  - Transportation
  - Primary industry, manufacturing
  - Natural carbon store preservation (forests, soils, peatlands, wetlands, kelp forests)
- **Pricing:** Adjustable rewards for cost-effectiveness
- **Mechanism:** Flexible XCR grants to achieve vigorous decarbonization rates

### Reward Channel 3: Co-Benefits (Robin Hood Systems)
- **Purpose:** Incentivize harm reduction and co-benefit maximization
- **Stakeholder Types:**
  - Type 1: Community wellbeing
  - Type 2: Ecosystem health
  - Type 3: Industrial reliability
- **Mechanism:** Decentralized, open-source, democratic platforms for comparing projects
- **Process:** Periodic XCR redistribution among projects to:
  - Dis-incentivize harms
  - Incentivize co-benefits
  - Promote regeneration and resilience

---

## 5.4 Economic Driver: XCR Price Floor

**Definition (Definition Box 7 - Risk Cost of Carbon/RCC):**
- Globally-averaged marginal cost of CDR sufficient to remain within relatively safe carbon budget
- Assumes conventional mitigation proceeds at vigorous rate
- Estimated by Carbon Exchange Authority (CEA)
- Revised periodically based on:
  - New climate science
  - GHG trends
  - Technological advances
  - Developments influencing available carbon budget

**Temporal Structure (Figure 10):**
1. **Historical prices** (past data)
2. **~10 years of guaranteed prices** (rolling forward annually)
3. **~90 years of forward guidance** (rolling forward)

**Peak Timing:** Potentially mid-century (function of technological progress and factors impacting RCC)

**XCR vs. Government Bonds:**
- **Similarities:** Trade in secondary markets; prices vary with supply/demand
- **Differences:**
  - XCR prices only move **above** price floor (not below)
  - Price floor is policy-driven with rolling 10-year guarantee and 100-year guidance
  - XCR yield = annual % change in price floor (μ)
  - XCR floor anchored to globally averaged marginal CDR cost
  - Government bonds: coupon rate set by issuer; YTM departs from coupon under market forces
  - Bond payments rely on issuer credit; XCR always sellable to private buyers or central banks via CQE

---

## 5.5 Unit of Account

**Definition (Definition Box 8):**

**1 XCR = 1/R tonnes of mitigated CO₂e with 100+ years durability**

Where:
- **R = 1** for CDR projects (fixed)
- **R > 0** for conventional mitigation projects (adjusted over time)
- **R** = reward multiplier for reporting cost-effectiveness relative to marginal CDR cost

**Three Components:**
1. **Unit of time:** 100 years (ensures representation of true global warming potential)
2. **Unit of mass:** 1 tonne CO₂-equivalent (standard climate science metric)
3. **Reward multiplier (R):** Dimensionless factor enabling adjustable rewards for conventional mitigation

**Why R is Needed:**
- XCR is **NOT** a carbon credit (no offsetting function)
- Unit of account doesn't need to represent single standardized CO₂e mass
- Each XCR unit represents 'cost-effective mass' of CO₂e mitigated (not fixed mass)
- Enables adjustable rewards with single instrument
- Goal: Deliver 'safe' carbon balance (not merely track mitigated GHG mass)

**Reward Multiplier (Definition Box 9):**
- Non-dimensional factor for adjusting XCR issued to mitigation projects
- Benchmark (R=1): Globally-averaged marginal CDR cost conforming to declared roadmap
- R values adjusted to ensure conventional mitigation projects receive sufficient finance for milestones/outcomes
- Used to compare cost-effectiveness across projects, technologies, industries, sectors, or average CDR cost

## 5.6 Carbon Reward Accounting

**Framework Purpose:**
- Address XCR's unit of account
- Support century-scale mitigation ambition
- Provide pragmatic financial support

### 5.6.1 Project Portfolios for Organizations
- Each organization manages entire operation as portfolio of mitigation projects
- Each project has dedicated carbon reward account
- Accounts inter-linked for tracking carbon movement within organization (limits greenwashing)
- Requirements:
  - Periodic updates, audits, validation
  - Real-time monitoring and data tracking
  - **Denominated in national currency (NOT XCR)** to avoid R-related accounting errors

### 5.6.2 Cost-Effectiveness Reporting with R
- All accounts denominated in national currency (not R)
- R = cost-effectiveness indicator for comparisons:
  - Expected vs. actual costs
  - Project costs vs. industry averages

**Example (XCR guaranteed value = US$100):**

| Project Type | Reward | CO₂e Mitigated | R Value | Calculation |
|--------------|--------|----------------|---------|-------------|
| CDR | $100/tonne | 1 tonne | R=1 | Global market, fixed |
| Reforestation | $75/tonne | 1.33 tonnes per XCR | R=0.75 | Lower additional cost |
| Coal-to-solar | $150/tonne | 0.67 tonnes per XCR | R=1.5 | Higher additional cost |

### 5.6.3 Time-Split Rewards
**Ex-ante rewards:** Cover project establishment and running costs
- Tied to verifiable milestones
- Help with upfront capital expenditure

**Ex-post rewards:** Issued after periodic verification
- Ensure adherence to durability targets
- Distributed over decades as carbon stocks mature

**Example:** Mangrove restoration
- 30% ex-ante for site preparation
- 70% ex-post distributed over decades as carbon matures

### 5.6.4 Milestone-Driven Rewards
XCR grants paid ex-ante structured by milestones:
- Feasibility, site selection, permitting
- Design, financing, procurement
- Construction, commissioning
- Operation, maintenance
- Closure, decommissioning

**Benefits:**
- Links rewards to performance
- Reduces project risks through staged payments
- Reduces uncertainty in financial planning
- Allows renegotiations based on external factors

### 5.6.5 Pro-Rata Rewards
Partial payments for:
- Mitigation periods less than 100-year standard
- Projects needing financial support due to unexpected costs (extreme weather, political crises, pandemics)

**Formula:** Fair reward calculation for <100-year durability

**Purpose:**
- Maintain project financial viability
- Facilitate early closure when circumstances demand

### 5.6.6 Clawback Provisions
Invoked for:
1. Unintentional mitigation backsliding → overpayment recovery
2. Poor management, negligence, errors, misconduct
3. Profit ceiling enforcement on individuals/organizations

- Federal Reserve swap lines - 2007-9

**Structure:**
- Alliance of central banks implementing XCR price floor
- Connected to CEA through monetary board
- Monetary board mandated to determine and revise XCR price floor

**Primary Function:**
Act as 'market maker' via Carbon Quantitative Easing (CQE)

**Carbon Quantitative Easing (CQE) - Definition Box 10:**
- Internationally coordinated monetary program
- Each central bank purchases XCR with new bank reserves
- Purchase volumes defined by common CQE formula
- Designed for fairness and minimal monetary effects (inflation, exchange rate volatility)
- **Difference from traditional QE:**
  - Long-term and strategic
  - Does NOT involve buying government bonds, green bonds, or other securities
  - ONLY purchases XCR when spot price threatens to fall below floor

**Legal Requirements:**
- Most central banks need explicit legal authority for CQE
- Currently lack mandates for carbon market interventions
- Central bank actions governed by national law mandates (Tamez et al. 2024)

**International Equity Design:**
- XCR purchase requirements allocated per central bank via formula
- Formula produces:
  - Minimal currency exchange rate disruption
  - Acceptable monetary inflation levels
- CEA directs carbon rewards to developing economies for sustainable development

**Trade-offs for Stakeholders:**
- CQE-driven monetary inflation (see Section 6.6)
- Partial loss of central bank sovereignty
- Exchange for avoiding hazardous climate change

**Key Outcomes:**

1. **Establishing Reliable Value**
   - XCR becomes carbon-linked sovereign-backed asset
   - Long-term value reliability for sustainability issues

2. **Creating Investment Confidence**
   - Rolling 10-year guarantee enables project developers to secure debt/equity financing
   - Based on XCR earnings estimates

3. **Facilitating Market Liquidity**
   - XCR trading and price floor in FX markets
   - Attracts currency traders, pension funds, investors
   - Limited downside risk appeal
   - Global capital redistribution potentially >US$3 trillion/year
   - Aims to bridge climate finance gap

4. **Improving Systemic Stability**
   - During market turbulence: risk-averse investors hedge with XCR holdings
   - Redirects financial capital toward decarbonization
   - Provides financial system anti-fragility
