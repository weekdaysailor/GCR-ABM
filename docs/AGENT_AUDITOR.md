# Agent: Auditor (MRV)
**Role:** Verification and Risk Management

## Objective
To ensure the integrity of the 100-year durability requirement for carbon sequestration.

## Key Logic
1. **Stochastic Decay:** Models "natural" project failures (fires, leaks, tech failure) as random events.
2. **Detection:** Auditors check project health with a 2% Error Rate (Class 3 Operational Risk).
3. **Clawback Execution:** If a failure is detected, the auditor triggers a **Clawback**, revoking a portion of previously awarded XCR from the developer.
4. **System Feedback:** Frequent clawbacks lower Investor Sentiment and force the CEA to lower the R-multiplier for high-risk project types.
