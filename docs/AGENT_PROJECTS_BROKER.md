**Role:** The Mitigators (Carbon Producers)

## Objective
To supply sequestration (Gt/yr) by responding to the XCR reward price.

## Key Logic
1. **Channel Management:** - **Channel 1:** High-volume CDR (Brazil/Indonesia).
   - **Channel 2:** Energy asset exchanges/Renewables (USA/Germany).
   - **Channel 3:** Co-benefits/Agro-ecology (Kenya).
2. **Utility Maximization:** Projects are initiated when $(XCR\_Price \times R) > Marginal\_Abatement\_Cost$.
3. **Milestones:** Rewards are granted only upon verification of milestones (Annual sequestration).
